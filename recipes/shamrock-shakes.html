    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Shamrock Shake is a creamy seasonal milkshake that is famously sold at McDonald's during March to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Introduced in 1970, the shake originally had a lemon-lime flavor. It is still vibrant green, but it is mint-flavored these days. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Ice cream</strong> and <strong>milk</strong>: Like many milkshakes, this Shamrock Shake starts with vanilla ice cream and milk.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Mint extract</strong>: Mint extract gives the shake its signature minty freshness. It packs a powerful punch, so use the extract sparingly.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Food coloring</strong>: About nine drops of green food coloring will dye your milkshake a gorgeous emerald hue.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Chocolate syrup</strong>: Drizzle chocolate syrup inside the glass for an impressive presentation.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Whipped cream</strong>: Top the Shamrock Shake with store-bought or homemade whipped cream.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Decorating sugar</strong>: A sprinkle of green decorating sugar is the perfect finishing touch.</p></li>
    </ul>
